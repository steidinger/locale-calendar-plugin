This project contains a plugin for the [Locale application](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/) which allows
you to change your phone settings depending on whether one of your calendars has an entry or not. I find it quite useful
to make sure that my phone is set to silent mode whenever the calendar I use for work related appointments
contains an entry.
